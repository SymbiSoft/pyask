Welcome!

PyAsk 2 is an open source app written in Python for s60 which asks you from predefinied words. It allows you to create words and own dicts on the way to school or university enchancing your abilities to learn other language!

If you would like my app please consider making a donate (I'm a poor Polish student :) ):

In the second version I’ve added:

  * sis installer
  * ‘both-side-asking’
  * option to add many synonyms splitted with commas (like: sysnonym1, synonym2,… synonymN)
  * small improvements as the number of synonyms (x) and the number of current question (#x/y) in the query window


Attention!
The old format dicts from version < 2, won't work anymore
Don't use any special characters like polish letters since they are still not implemented!



The dicts are being stored in E:\dicts\ directory, if you don't have a E: drive on your mobile, simply change all the E: to C: in the source code.
